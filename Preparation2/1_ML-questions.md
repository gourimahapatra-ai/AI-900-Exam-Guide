## Q24: Splitting Data for Machine Learning

> In a machine learning process, how should you split your data for training and evaluation to ensure effective model development?

**Options:**
- [ ] A. Use features for training and labels for evaluation. `This is incorrect because features are the input data used for training the model, while labels are the output data used for evaluation.`
- [ ] C. Use labels for training and features for evaluation. `This is incorrect because labels are the target outputs that the model aims to predict, and features are the inputs used to train the model.`
- [ ] B. Randomly split the data into columns for training and columns for evaluation. `This is incorrect because splitting data by columns would separate features from labels, making it impossible to train the model effectively.`
- [x] D. Randomly split the data into rows for training and rows for evaluation. `This is the correct answer. Randomly splitting the data into rows ensures that both the training and evaluation sets are representative of the overall dataset, leading to more reliable model performance.`
